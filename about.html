    <p>Hey! My name is Yuliana, I am from St. Petersburg, Russia. My family immigrated to Canada three years ago. I'm a CPA student and have a lot of fun studying at college. My education in the country of origin is a laser systems engineer, but my work has always been related to information technology. My last work in Russia: a mobile operator. I worked in a team that was developing a mobile application. In addition to my studies, I am raising my son - he is almost five years old. In my free time I like to read books: lately it has been specialized literature in my professional direction or something about child psychology. I love to play sports, cook and hate cleaning the house.</p>
